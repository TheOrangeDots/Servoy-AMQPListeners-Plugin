# Servoy-AMQPListeners-Plugin
The `AMQPListeners` plugin for [Servoy](http://servoy.com) allows a Servoy ApplicationServer instance to listen to AMQP Queues and when receiving a message will invoke the configured method in a Servoy Solution, utilizing a pool of Headless Clients

# Use case
This plugin was developed to be able to process queued messages in Servoy, without having to rely on a batchprocessor or another type of client running 

# Requirements
- Servoy: tested with Servoy 8.x
- RabbitMQ: only tested with RabbitMQ, but should work with anything that supports AMQP

# Installation

# Usage

For example:
```javascript
```
